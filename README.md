This project was an in-depth statistical data analysis comparing the performance of Apple Watch and Fitbit fitness trackers. Developed and implemented machine learning models in both R and Python.

The dataset was acquired on Kaggle but originally obtained by a study conducted at the Memorial University of Newfoundland with help from the University of Toronto and University of Oregon.
